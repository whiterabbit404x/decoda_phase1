# Phase 1 Tokenized Treasury Risk-Control Monorepo

This repo now supports a reproducible local Phase 1 workflow without Docker as the primary path. The stable Phase 1 risk-engine remains intact, Feature 2 adds the `threat-engine` service for explainable zero-day exploit mitigation and treasury-token market anomaly detection, Feature 3 adds the `compliance-service` for sovereign-grade compliance wrappers, geopatriation controls, and governance actions, and Feature 4 expands the existing `reconciliation-service` into an interoperability and systemic resilience slice for deterministic cross-chain reconciliation, backstop controls, and local incident logging.

## Public self-serve SaaS mode (Railway + Vercel + Neon)

The repo now supports a production-oriented **public self-serve SaaS mode** alongside the existing local/demo mode. Demo endpoints and UI still work, but authenticated live-mode actions persist workspace-scoped data through `services/api` into Neon Postgres. The backend deployment model remains the same: Railway still runs the existing API Dockerfile, and Vercel still hosts the Next.js frontend.

### Pilot architecture changes

- `services/api` remains the gateway and now also owns auth, workspace membership, audit logging, and persisted pilot records.
- Existing backend services (`risk-engine`, `threat-engine`, `compliance-service`, `reconciliation-service`) remain computation/demo providers; the gateway persists live summaries and workflow records after it calls them.
- Live mode writes Neon-backed `users`, `workspaces`, `workspace_members`, `analysis_runs`, `alerts`, `governance_actions`, `incidents`, and `audit_logs`.
- Demo mode remains separate from live mode. Existing dashboard fallback/demo data never mixes with live customer records.

### Live-mode environment variables

#### Railway / API

- `LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true`
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` (Neon connection string, with `sslmode=require`)
- `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=<long-random-secret>`
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app`
- Existing downstream service URLs (`RISK_ENGINE_URL`, `THREAT_ENGINE_URL`, `COMPLIANCE_SERVICE_URL`, `RECONCILIATION_SERVICE_URL`)

#### Vercel / web

| Environment | Required vars | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true` or `false`; `API_URL=https://<your-railway-api>.up.railway.app` (preferred) or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-railway-api>.up.railway.app`; optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS=5000` | Production remains strict: `next build` fails before app code runs if `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED` is missing/invalid or if both API URL vars are absent. |
| Preview | `API_URL=https://<preview-or-shared-railway-api>.up.railway.app` (preferred) or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<preview-or-shared-railway-api>.up.railway.app`; `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true` or `false` is recommended | Preview builds now pass when `API_URL` exists even if `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is absent, because the same-origin auth proxy prefers `API_URL`. Preview still fails fast if both API URL vars are missing, and the build log now tells operators exactly which Vercel environment setting to fix. |
| Development | `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=false` (or `true` if you are exercising pilot mode locally), `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`, optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS=5000` | Local development still falls back to localhost defaults, but explicitly setting the vars keeps local behavior aligned with Vercel. |

Recommended Vercel project settings:

- **Root Directory:** `apps/web`
- **Framework Preset:** Next.js
- **Install Command:** repo-root install is fine, but the web project itself must still build from `apps/web` inside the monorepo.

Operator checklist for Vercel build validation:

1. Set **Root Directory = `apps/web`**.
2. For **Preview**, configure at least one backend URL in Vercel. `API_URL` is preferred because the same-origin auth proxy reads the server-side value first; `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is an acceptable fallback when a public browser URL is required.
3. For **Production**, configure both a valid `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED` value (`true` or `false`) and at least one backend URL (`API_URL` preferred, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` fallback).
4. If a preview build fails, read the build log block from `apps/web/build/vercel-build-validation.js`: it prints `vercelEnv`, branch, commit SHA, cwd, expected root directory, and found/missing status for `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED`, `API_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

#### PR preview troubleshooting

- **Root Directory** must be `apps/web` so the monorepo build runs the intended Next.js app and validation script.
- Preview vars must exist on the **same linked Vercel project** connected to the GitHub repo; setting them on a different Vercel project will not unblock the PR deployment.
- The same-origin auth proxy prefers `API_URL`; use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` only when the browser truly needs a separate public backend origin.
- Old preview URLs may be stale if newer preview deploys fail, so always compare the failed build log's branch/commit block before debugging runtime behavior.

### Migrations and seed commands

Run these from the repo root after setting `DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` for the API service:

```bash
python services/api/scripts/migrate.py
python services/api/scripts/seed.py --pilot-demo
```

The pilot demo seed creates a workspace-scoped demo account in Postgres while preserving the original local SQLite registry seed for demo mode. You can override the seeded credentials with `--demo-email`, `--demo-password`, `--demo-workspace`, and `--demo-full-name`.

### Railway deploy / update flow

Run **two Railway services** from this monorepo for production monitoring:

1. Create `decoda-api` service:
   - Dockerfile path: `services/api/Dockerfile`
   - Root/build context: repository root
   - `APP_START_COMMAND` (optional, default): `uvicorn services.api.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}`
2. Create `decoda-monitoring-worker` service from the same repo:
   - Dockerfile path: `services/api/Dockerfile`
   - Root/build context: repository root
   - Start command env override:
     - `APP_START_COMMAND=python -m services.api.app.run_monitoring_worker --worker-name railway-monitoring-worker --interval-seconds 15 --limit 50`
3. Keep the Docker build context at the repo root so `services/api/Dockerfile` can `COPY` sibling fixture folders such as `services/risk-engine/data` and `services/reconciliation-service/data`.
4. Set Railway env vars from `services/api/.env.example` on **both** services, including monitoring worker vars (`MONITORING_WORKER_NAME`, `MONITORING_WORKER_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, `MONITORING_WORKER_LIMIT`, optional `MONITORING_WORKER_HEARTBEAT_TTL_SECONDS`).
5. Run migrations against Neon with `python services/api/scripts/migrate.py` in Railway's shell or a one-off command using the same image/env.
6. Optionally run `python services/api/scripts/seed.py --pilot-demo` once for a demo tenant.
7. Verify worker heartbeat via `GET /ops/monitoring/health` on the API service.
8. For manual one-shot verification in Railway shell, run `python -m services.api.app.run_monitoring_worker --once` (or `python services/api/scripts/run_monitoring_worker.py --once`).

### Vercel setup flow

1. Keep deploying `apps/web` on Vercel.
2. Set Vercel env vars from `apps/web/.env.example`.
3. Redeploy after updating `API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, or `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED`.
4. Use `/sign-up`, `/sign-in`, and `/workspaces` for live pilot onboarding while `/` continues to expose the existing dashboard.

### Why preview can fail while production works

Preview deploys are more likely to fail than production in this monorepo because Vercel treats **environment scopes**, **root-directory settings**, and **branch-specific config** separately:

- Production can keep working while Preview is broken if Preview is missing both `API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, or if Preview has an invalid `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED` value. Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED` alone now warns instead of blocking the deploy.
- Production can keep working while Preview is broken if the Vercel project root points somewhere other than `apps/web`, because the monorepo build will resolve a different working directory during `next build`.
- Preview can fail at build time even before auth traffic reaches Railway, while production appears healthy, because `apps/web/next.config.js` runs `build/vercel-build-validation.js` during `next build` and Vercel stops the deployment before app code executes.
- Preview can also reach runtime with the wrong backend target if branch-specific env vars drift. In that case, `/api/build-info` tells operators whether the issue is the build, the preview environment, or the resolved runtime config.

Fast operator checks:

1. Confirm the Vercel project **Root Directory** is `apps/web`.
2. Confirm the Preview environment in Vercel has at least one of `API_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`; `API_URL` is preferred because the same-origin auth proxy uses the server-side value first.
3. If the build logs warn about `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED`, add it explicitly so preview/demo mode and live-mode behavior are obvious to operators.
4. Open `/api/build-info` on the preview deployment and verify `vercelEnv`, `branch`, `commitSha`, and the runtime config summary.
5. If `/api/build-info` is healthy but auth still fails, the next place to check is the backend API / Railway deployment rather than the same-origin auth proxy.

### External requirements before enterprise claims

- Email verification, password reset, and server-side session invalidation.
- TOTP MFA, distributed/shared-store auth rate limiting, background workers, webhooks, and billing automation are still planned before GA.
- Stronger distributed rate limiting / shared cache instead of in-memory auth throttling.
- Richer RBAC enforcement across every workflow action.
- Background jobs, webhooks, and more granular per-record dashboards instead of summary persistence only.
- Managed observability, secret rotation, and tenant billing / provisioning workflows.

## Self-serve public beta foundations (this pass)

The API now includes real self-serve security foundations intended for public-beta usage:

- **Transactional email provider abstraction** (`EMAIL_PROVIDER=console|resend`) for verification/reset flows.
- **TOTP MFA backend flows**:
  - `POST /auth/mfa/enroll`
  - `POST /auth/mfa/confirm`
  - `POST /auth/mfa/complete-signin`
  - `POST /auth/mfa/disable`
- **Session controls**:
  - `GET /auth/sessions`
  - `POST /auth/sessions/revoke`
  - existing `POST /auth/signout-all`
- **Background jobs foundation**:
  - database-backed `background_jobs` queue
  - `python services/api/scripts/run_worker.py` worker loop
  - `POST /ops/jobs/run` operator one-shot job execution
- **Distributed auth rate limiting** with Redis when `REDIS_URL` is configured, with safe in-memory fallback for local/dev only.
- **Startup runtime validation** for production-like environments (fails fast for missing critical auth config, warns on unsafe production settings).

### New API environment variables

- `APP_ENV=development|production`
- `APP_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-app.example.com`
- `AUTH_EXPOSE_DEBUG_TOKENS=false`
- `MFA_ISSUER=Decoda RWA Guard`
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER=console|resend`
- `EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@decoda.app`
- `EMAIL_BRAND_NAME=Decoda RWA Guard`
- `EMAIL_RESEND_API_KEY=...` (required when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend`)
- `REDIS_URL=redis://...` (required for distributed rate limiting)
- `BACKGROUND_JOBS_MODE=inline|queued`

### Worker process

Run a dedicated API worker process in production when using queued jobs:

```bash
python services/api/scripts/run_worker.py --worker-id railway-worker-1 --interval-seconds 2
```

For operator-triggered one-shot execution from the API service:

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_URL/ops/jobs/run" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"worker_id":"ops","limit":25}'
```

Run the dedicated threat monitoring worker process in production:

```bash
python -m services.api.app.run_monitoring_worker --worker-name railway-monitoring-worker --interval-seconds 15 --limit 50
```

One-shot diagnostic cycle (safe to run manually in Railway shell):

```bash
python -m services.api.app.run_monitoring_worker --once --worker-name railway-monitoring-worker --limit 50
```

### Honest remaining gaps before true GA / enterprise claims

- Frontend MFA enrollment/challenge UX is not fully wired end-to-end yet.
- Core customer-operable flows are now live in product UI: workspace team admin (member role changes/removal/invites/revoke/resend), seat visibility, billing checkout + portal launch, webhook management (create/edit/enable/rotate/deliveries), and findings decisions/actions workflow.
- Formal SOC 2 control evidence, key rotation automation, and full incident-response runbooks are still required for enterprise procurement.

## Self-serve onboarding wizard (this pass)

The product now includes a persisted, resumable onboarding checklist for each workspace:

- API endpoints: `GET /onboarding/state`, `PATCH /onboarding/state`.
- Database-backed state table: `workspace_onboarding_states` (migration `0010_onboarding_state.sql`).
- Checklist merges **automatic milestones** (asset added, integration connected, invited teammates, analysis run) with **manual setup confirmations** (industry profile and policy baseline).
- UI entry points: `/onboarding`, dashboard onboarding panel progress, and in-app `/help` start-here guide.

This closes a core founder-led gap by making first-run setup resumable and visible to the customer from within the product.

## Workspace operations workflow (live mode)

Recent SaaS workflow upgrades now prioritize real customer records over scenario-only data in authenticated routes:

- Workspace-scoped **Assets CRUD**: `GET/POST /assets`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /assets/{id}`.
- Workspace-scoped **Targets CRUD**: `GET/POST /targets`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /targets/{id}`.
- Module config persistence with workspace RBAC: `GET/PUT /modules/{threat|compliance|resilience}/config`.
- History retrieval for operator review: `GET /history`, `GET /history/{id}`.
- Export endpoints include findings plus list/detail status tracking: `POST /exports/findings`, `GET /exports`, `GET /exports/{id}`.
- Export downloads now return real generated artifacts at `GET /exports/{id}/download` (CSV/JSON) with files stored under `EXPORTS_DIR` (`/tmp/decoda-exports` by default).
- Alert notifications now queue outbound webhook/email delivery attempts via `background_jobs`; run `python services/api/scripts/run_worker.py` to process queued deliveries.
- Slack alerting is now supported via incoming webhooks (`/integrations/slack`) with delivery logs, test-send, retries, and routing preferences (`/integrations/routing/{channel_type}`).
- Stripe checkout/portal endpoints now require live provider configuration (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, plus `plan_entitlements.stripe_price_id` per plan) and no longer create local placeholder subscriptions.
- Team and seat administration endpoints: `PATCH/DELETE /workspace/members/{id}`, `GET /team/seats`.
- Team invitation lifecycle endpoints: `GET/POST /workspace/invitations`, `POST /workspace/invitations/{id}/resend`, `DELETE /workspace/invitations/{id}`, `POST /workspace/invitations/accept`.
- Finding action workflow endpoints: `POST /findings/{id}/decision`, `POST /findings/{id}/actions`, `PATCH /actions/{id}`, `GET /actions`, `GET /decisions`.
- Protected pages now follow an auth-safe client fetch pattern using `usePilotAuth().authHeaders()` for workspace-scoped calls (`alerts`, `integrations`, `templates`, and settings subflows).

Templates remain onboarding-only (`GET /templates`, `POST /templates/{id}/apply`) and do not replace live customer data in authenticated operations.

### 6) Local ports used by the repo-root service runner

These are the exact defaults used by `python scripts\run_service.py <service>` from the repo root on Windows CMD.

| Service | Port | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API gateway | `8000` | `http://localhost:8000` |
| risk-engine | `8001` | `http://localhost:8001` |
| threat-engine | `8002` | `http://localhost:8002` |
| oracle-service | `8003` | `http://localhost:8003` |
| compliance-service | `8004` | `http://localhost:8004` |
| reconciliation-service | `8005` | `http://localhost:8005` |
| web app | `3000` | `http://localhost:3000` |

### 7) Open the local apps

- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Risk-engine docs: `http://localhost:8001/docs`
- Threat-engine docs: `http://localhost:8002/docs`
- Oracle-service docs: `http://localhost:8003/docs`
- Compliance-service docs: `http://localhost:8004/docs`
- Reconciliation-service docs: `http://localhost:8005/docs`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`

## Local backend behavior

- `services/api` defaults to `RISK_ENGINE_URL=http://localhost:8001`, `THREAT_ENGINE_URL=http://localhost:8002`, `COMPLIANCE_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8004`, and `RECONCILIATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8005`.
- `services/api /risk/dashboard` prefers live risk-engine evaluations.
- `services/api /threat/dashboard` prefers live threat-engine data for Feature 2 cards, alerts, and detections.
- `services/api /compliance/dashboard` prefers live compliance-service data for Feature 3 transfer wrappers, residency controls, policy state, and governance ledger panels.
- `services/api /resilience/dashboard` prefers live reconciliation-service data for Feature 4 reconciliation, backstop controls, and local incident ledger panels.
- If any backend is unavailable or times out, the API returns explicit fallback-safe dashboard data instead of failing the UI.
- The dashboard renders both live and degraded states without blanking the page.
- Browser demo interactions call the API gateway, not the backend workers directly, so the Windows CMD workflow remains repo-root friendly.

## Demo walkthroughs for Features 2, 3, and 4

These walkthroughs assume you started the services with the exact Windows CMD commands above and that the dashboard is running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Feature 2 demo walkthrough — threat analysis

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` and scroll to **Feature 2 · Preemptive Cybersecurity & AI Threat Defense**.
2. Confirm the runtime banner says the API and backend services are online.
3. In **Feature 2 demo interactions**, click **Flash-loan-like tx** and confirm the result returns a high score with a `block` recommendation.
4. Click **Admin abuse tx** to inspect the privilege-abuse path and compare the explanation + matched reasons.
5. Click **Normal market** or **Spoofing-like market** to see the market anomaly flow exercise `POST /threat/analyze/market`.
6. Review **Active alerts** and **Recent detections** to confirm the dashboard cards match the current threat-engine feed.

### Feature 3 demo walkthrough — compliance wrappers and governance

1. Scroll to **Feature 3 · Sovereign-Grade Compliance & Governance**.
2. In **Compliance Operations**, leave **Compliant transfer approved** selected and click **Run transfer screening**.
3. Switch to **Blocked by sanctions** or **Review for incomplete KYC** and run the transfer screening again to compare deterministic wrapper reasons.
4. In the residency section, run **Denied restricted region** to verify the geopatriation controls and routing recommendation.
5. In the governance section, submit **Freeze wallet**, **Pause asset**, or **Allowlist wallet**.
6. After the page refreshes, verify the new governance record appears under **Latest governance actions** and that **Asset transfer status** / policy state cards reflect the updated state.

### Feature 4 demo walkthrough — reconciliation, backstops, and incidents

1. Scroll to **Feature 4 · Interoperability & Systemic Resilience**.
2. In **Resilience Operations**, run **Critical divergence** to compare expected supply vs. observed multi-ledger supply.
3. Run **Pause bridge** in the backstop section to exercise the deterministic restricted / paused safeguards.
4. Run **Reconciliation failure** or **Market circuit breaker** in the incident section to append a new resilience incident record.
5. Confirm the response payloads render in the demo panel and then review **Ledger assessments**, **Backstop decision**, and **Latest incident records** for the matching dashboard state.
6. Optionally refresh the page once more to verify the latest incident list remains visible from the local ledger.

## Feature 2 smoke / regression tests

### What the smoke suite covers

- Backend pytest smoke checks for `GET /threat/dashboard`, `POST /threat/analyze/transaction`, `POST /threat/analyze/market`, and `POST /threat/analyze/contract`.
- Stable response-shape assertions for `score`, `severity`, `matched_patterns`, `recommended_action`, and dashboard anomaly metadata.
- Explicit fallback-shape verification when the threat-engine is unavailable.
- Frontend Playwright smoke coverage for `http://localhost:3000`, the Feature 2 dashboard section, and a no-blank-page / no-fatal-crash sanity check.

### Install the smoke-test dependencies once

#### Python

```cmd
python -m pip install -r requirements-local.txt
```

#### Playwright package + browser

```cmd
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### Windows CMD: exact smoke-test commands from the repo root

#### Backend Feature 2 smoke tests

```cmd
python -m pytest services\api\tests\test_feature2_smoke.py -q
```

#### Repo-root pytest run

```cmd
pytest -q
```

This repo-root pytest command is now scoped through `pytest.ini` so the service test suites run cleanly from the monorepo root without cross-importing the wrong `app` package.

#### Frontend Feature 2 smoke test

Start the frontend first in another terminal:

```cmd
npm run dev --workspace apps/web
```

Then run:

```cmd
npx playwright test apps\web\tests\feature2-smoke.spec.ts
```

#### Full smoke suite in one repo-root command

Start the frontend first in another terminal, then run:

```cmd
python scripts\smoke_feature2.py
```

Or use the npm wrapper:

```cmd
npm run smoke:feature2
```

`scripts\smoke_feature2.py` now waits longer for `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, retries before failing, and reports whether the Next.js app appears to still be compiling versus not running at all.
It now uses a two-step frontend readiness check: a lightweight `GET /api/health` probe confirms that the Next.js dev server is alive first, then the script retries the homepage with a longer per-request timeout so slow cold-start compiles do not produce false "frontend unavailable" failures.

### Which services must be running first?

- `python -m pytest services\api\tests\test_feature2_smoke.py -q` — **no services required**. The backend smoke checks use FastAPI's in-process test client and stub the threat-engine availability states.
- `npx playwright test apps\web\tests\feature2-smoke.spec.ts` — **requires the Next.js frontend on `http://localhost:3000`**. The page can still render fallback content if the API gateway or threat-engine are offline.
- `npm run smoke:feature2` — **requires the Next.js frontend on `http://localhost:3000`** because the Python runner executes backend pytest first and then the Playwright smoke test.

### `POST /threat/analyze/market` spoofing-like market behavior

Use `services\threat-engine\data\spoofing_market_behavior.json`.

### `POST /threat/analyze/market` wash-trading-like market behavior

Use `services\threat-engine\data\wash_trading_market_behavior.json`.

## Demo flow for Feature 2

1. Start `risk-engine`, `threat-engine`, `api`, and `web` from the repo root using the commands above.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
3. In the new **Feature 2 · Preemptive Cybersecurity & AI Threat Defense** section, review the threat score cards, active alerts, market anomaly summary, and recent detections.
4. Use the in-browser demo panel to trigger safe transaction, flash-loan-like transaction, admin privilege abuse, normal market, spoofing-like market, wash-trading-like market, or contract scan analyses.
5. Compare the allow / review / block results with the reasons list to see which deterministic rules fired.
6. Stop `threat-engine` and refresh the dashboard to verify that the API gateway and UI degrade gracefully to fallback Feature 2 data.

## Validation / smoke checks

### Python service tests

```cmd
python -m unittest services.risk-engine.tests.test_risk_engine
python -m unittest services.threat-engine.tests.test_threat_engine
python -m unittest services.api.tests.test_risk_dashboard
```

### Frontend build validation

```cmd
npm run build --workspace apps/web
```

### Repo smoke check

```cmd
python scripts\smoke_phase1.py
```

The smoke checks prove that:

- the risk-engine starts,
- the threat-engine starts,
- the API starts,
- the API fetches live risk-engine and threat-engine data when available, and
- the API returns frontend-safe fallback shapes when the backends become unavailable.

## Final local verification checklist

From the repo root on Windows CMD, use these exact commands to verify the polish pass locally after starting the services and web app:

```cmd
python -m pytest services\api\tests\test_feature2_smoke.py -q
python -m pytest services\api\tests\test_feature3_smoke.py -q
python -m pytest services\api\tests\test_feature4_smoke.py -q
python -m pytest services\api\tests\test_risk_dashboard.py -q
npx playwright test apps\web\tests\feature2-smoke.spec.ts
npx playwright test apps\web\tests\feature3-smoke.spec.ts
npx playwright test apps\web\tests\feature4-smoke.spec.ts
```

Files changed in this polish pass:

- `README.md`
- `services/api/app/main.py`
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx`

## Optional Docker support

Docker remains available as an optional workflow through `docker-compose.yml`, but it is no longer the primary local path.

### Expected demo flow for Feature 3

1. Start `risk-engine`, `threat-engine`, `compliance-service`, `api`, and `apps/web` from the repo root.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` and scroll to **Feature 3 · Sovereign-Grade Compliance & Governance**.
3. Review the transfer wrapper cards, residency decision, policy-state counts, and latest governance actions.
4. Use the Feature 3 demo panel to run a transfer screening, run a residency screening, and submit a governance action.
5. Refresh the page or re-open `GET /compliance/dashboard` to verify that governance actions update policy state and asset transfer status.
6. Stop `compliance-service` and retry the same dashboard/API flows to confirm the API gateway and UI degrade gracefully with explicit fallback data instead of blank states.

### Graceful fallback behavior

- If `compliance-service` is unavailable, the API gateway returns deterministic fallback Feature 3 payloads for the dashboard, transfer screening, residency screening, and governance actions.
- The dashboard renders fallback cards, governance actions, and demo interaction responses without a blank page.
- Feature 1 and Feature 2 routes continue to operate independently when Feature 3 is offline.

## Feature 4: interoperability & systemic resilience

Feature 4 extends the existing `services/reconciliation-service` instead of introducing a new service. The local vertical slice remains deterministic, explainable, and demoable without any real blockchain, bridge, exchange, or third-party network dependency.

### Current local ports

- API gateway: `http://localhost:8000`
- Risk-engine: `http://localhost:8001`
- Threat-engine: `http://localhost:8002`
- Oracle-service: `http://localhost:8003`
- Compliance-service: `http://localhost:8004`
- Reconciliation-service: `http://localhost:8005`
- Web dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`

### Windows CMD: exact Feature 4 run commands from the repo root

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
python services\reconciliation-service\scripts\seed.py
python scripts\run_service.py reconciliation-service --reload
```

```cmd

### Sample curl requests for Feature 4

#### 1) Resilience dashboard

```cmd
curl http://localhost:8000/resilience/dashboard
```

#### 2) Cross-chain reconciliation

```cmd

```

### Expected demo flow for Feature 4

1. Start `risk-engine`, `threat-engine`, `compliance-service`, `reconciliation-service`, `api`, and `web` from the repo root.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000` and scroll to **Feature 4 · Interoperability & Systemic Resilience**.
3. Review the reconciliation cards for mismatch amount, severity, stale ledger count, and current backstop decision.
4. Use the Feature 4 demo panel to run a reconciliation scenario, run a backstop evaluation, and record an incident.
5. Open `http://localhost:8005/docs` or `http://localhost:8000/docs` to replay the same scenarios with the OpenAPI examples.
6. Stop `reconciliation-service` and refresh the dashboard or retry the same API requests to confirm the API gateway and UI degrade gracefully to explicit fallback resilience data.

### Graceful fallback behavior

- If `reconciliation-service` is unavailable, the API gateway returns deterministic fallback Feature 4 payloads for the dashboard, reconciliation, backstop evaluation, and incident creation flows.
- The dashboard still renders reconciliation cards, safeguards, and recent incident records without blank sections.
- Features 2 and 3 continue to operate independently when Feature 4 is offline.

### Feature 4 smoke / regression commands

```cmd
python -m pytest services\reconciliation-service\tests\test_reconciliation_service.py -q
python -m pytest services\api\tests\test_feature4_smoke.py -q
python scripts\smoke_feature4.py
```

## Customer deployment

This repo now ships with a **split experience**:

- `/` is a public marketing homepage for Decoda RWA Guard.
- `/security` is the public trust/security page.
- `/dashboard`, `/threat`, `/compliance`, `/resilience`, `/history`, `/settings`, and `/settings/security` are the authenticated product routes.
- The product always prefers live data first, but it preserves the existing deterministic fallback and sample-safe behavior so the UI never blanks when a dependency is unavailable.

### Railway requirements (API)

- **Build context must remain the repo root.** Railway must build from the repository root so `services/api/Dockerfile` can copy the sibling fixture and service folders used by graceful fallback mode.
- **Deploy target remains `services/api/Dockerfile`.**
- Required Railway environment variables:
  - `LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true` for persisted workspace records.
  - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` using the Neon connection string and `sslmode=require`.
  - `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=<long-random-secret>`.
  - `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app`.
  - `RISK_ENGINE_URL`, `THREAT_ENGINE_URL`, `COMPLIANCE_SERVICE_URL`, and `RECONCILIATION_SERVICE_URL` for the existing downstream services.
  - Any existing mode/build variables already used by `services/api` should stay in place.

### Vercel requirements (web)

- Vercel should continue deploying the `apps/web` project.
- The Vercel **Root Directory** should remain `apps/web` for this monorepo.
- Required Vercel environment variables by scope:
  - **Production:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true`, `API_URL=https://<your-railway-api>.up.railway.app` (preferred) or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-railway-api>.up.railway.app`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS=5000`.
  - **Preview:** `API_URL=https://<preview-or-shared-railway-api>.up.railway.app` (preferred) or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<preview-or-shared-railway-api>.up.railway.app`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS=5000`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=true` is strongly recommended so operators can see the intended mode directly in build logs and runtime diagnostics.
  - **Development:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED=false` (or `true` when testing pilot mode locally), `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`, and optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS=5000`.
- Production builds fail clearly when `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED` is missing/invalid or when both API URL variables are absent. Preview builds now warn for missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED`, prefer server-side `API_URL`, and only fail when the missing API settings would leave the auth proxy unusable before runtime.
- Operators can inspect `/api/build-info` to see the deployment environment, branch, commit SHA, and runtime-config summary before debugging the backend.
- The web app uses the API URL to resolve **live**, **live (degraded)**, **fallback**, and **sample** states in the UI.

### Neon / Postgres expectations

- `DATABASE_URL` must point at the Neon Postgres database used for live pilot persistence.
- The connection string should include SSL requirements expected by Neon, typically `sslmode=require`.
- Live workspace history writes to the existing pilot tables: `users`, `workspaces`, `workspace_members`, `analysis_runs`, `alerts`, `governance_actions`, `incidents`, and `audit_logs`.

### Migration and seed flow

Run these commands from the repo root after setting the Railway/Neon API environment variables locally or in a one-off deploy shell:

```bash
python services/api/scripts/migrate.py
python services/api/scripts/seed.py --pilot-demo
```

- `migrate.py` applies the live pilot schema to Neon.
- `seed.py --pilot-demo` creates a demo workspace/user for customer walkthroughs while preserving the existing local demo workflow.
- `AUTH_EXPOSE_DEBUG_TOKENS=true` can be used in local/dev environments to return verification/reset tokens in API JSON for manual flow testing. Keep this disabled in shared/prod environments.

### Verifying live vs degraded vs fallback vs sample

Use `GET /health/details` together with the dashboard UI to verify the deployment mode:

1. **Live**: `/health/details` is reachable, the gateway is healthy, and product badges read `Live`.
2. **Live (degraded)**: the gateway is reachable but one or more feature feeds explain that fallback coverage is active.
3. **Fallback**: a feature badge reads `Fallback`, usually because a downstream dependency timed out or returned an error while the UI stayed populated.
4. **Sample**: no live API is configured for the web app, so deterministic sample-safe payloads render across the experience.

You can also inspect `/health/details` to confirm dependency diagnostics, build/runtime markers, and the current fallback-safe fixture resolution.

### Deployment checklist

- [ ] Railway build context is the **repo root**.
- [ ] Railway deploys `services/api/Dockerfile`.
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` points to Neon with SSL enabled.
- [ ] `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` is set.
- [ ] All downstream service URLs are configured.
- [ ] Vercel Production sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED`, at least one of `API_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- [ ] Vercel Preview sets at least one of `API_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`; add `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_MODE_ENABLED` as well so operators do not have to infer whether the deployment should run in demo or live mode.
- [ ] Vercel Root Directory is `apps/web`.
- [ ] `/api/build-info` reports the expected `vercelEnv`, branch, commit SHA, and runtime config summary on the deployed site.
- [ ] `python services/api/scripts/migrate.py` has been run against Neon.
- [ ] Optional pilot seed completed with `python services/api/scripts/seed.py --pilot-demo`.
- [ ] `/health/details` confirms expected dependency and runtime mode.
- [ ] `/` shows the marketing homepage and `/dashboard` opens the authenticated product experience.

### Secret hygiene after any suspected exposure

- Rotate `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` in Railway and redeploy the API so all newly issued auth tokens use the new secret.
- Rotate `DATABASE_URL` credentials in Neon/Railway if they were ever shared in logs or screenshots.
- Rotate Vercel + Railway API URL credentials if they include embedded credentials.
- Verify `GET /health` and dashboard APIs only return masked database configuration (`[configured]`) instead of raw DSNs before inviting external evaluators.


## Public self-serve SaaS additions (this pass)

- Billing foundations added in code + schema (`billing_customers`, `billing_subscriptions`, `billing_events`, `plan_entitlements`) with endpoints for plan listing, checkout session, portal session, subscription lookup, and Stripe webhook ingestion.
- Workspace team-management foundations added with invitation create/accept flows and workspace member listing.
- Workspace webhook-management foundations added with create/update/list/rotate-secret plus delivery listing.
- Dashboard fallback behavior is now strict in production/authenticated usage: demo payloads are only allowed when `ENABLE_DEMO_FALLBACKS=true` in non-production.

### New environment variables

- `ENABLE_DEMO_FALLBACKS=true|false` (non-production only; enables sample dashboard payloads)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...` (required to validate Stripe webhooks in production)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...` (required for real hosted checkout/portal wiring)
- `APP_URL=https://your-product-domain` (recommended for Slack alert deep links back into `/alerts`)

### Manual setup required

1. Run migrations: `python services/api/scripts/migrate.py`.
2. Configure Stripe products/prices and wire real checkout/portal calls (code currently ships safe placeholders that persist subscription state and audit events).
3. Configure webhook endpoint in Stripe to `POST /billing/webhooks/stripe` and set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
4. Provision a dedicated worker process for queued jobs on Railway.

### Honest external follow-up still required

- Independent penetration testing.
- SOC 2 evidence collection and audit execution.
- Legal/privacy policy and DPA reviews.
- Incident-response tabletop exercises and documented runbooks.
- Key-rotation and backup/restore drill operations.

## Customer-usable SaaS workflow modules (March 2026)

Authenticated product routes now prioritize **live customer operations** over guided scenario walkthroughs.

### Operational modules

- Threat Monitoring (`/threat`) with workspace target selection plus persisted module config.
- Compliance Controls (`/compliance`) with persisted review/evidence policy config and exports hook.
- Resilience Monitoring (`/resilience`) with saved monitoring thresholds and alert acknowledgement workflow.

### New customer data workflows

- Target Manager (`/targets`) for workspace-scoped targets and monitored actors.
- Alerts Center (`/alerts`) for workspace alert listing and lifecycle actions.
- Integrations (`/integrations`) for outbound webhook management and delivery visibility.
- Exports (`/exports`) for operational report export actions.
- Templates (`/templates`) as onboarding helpers only; templates are separate from live target/module records.

### Backend SaaS additions

- `targets` + `target_tags` workspace data model and CRUD endpoints.
- Workspace `module_configs` endpoints for threat/compliance/resilience policy persistence.
- Alert API endpoints for list/detail/status mutation with `alert_events` audit trail.
- Export job endpoints (`/exports/history`, `/exports/alerts`, `/exports/report`) backed by `export_jobs`.
- Integration webhook endpoints under `/integrations/webhooks/*` with secret rotation and delivery logs.
- Slack integration endpoints under `/integrations/slack*` (list/create/update/delete/test + delivery history) with webhook URLs masked in API responses.
- Alert routing endpoints under `/integrations/routing*` for per-channel severity thresholds and enable/disable controls.

### Slack setup (webhook + bot mode)

1. Open Decoda UI (`/integrations`) and choose Slack mode:
   - **Incoming webhook** for compatibility
   - **Bot token** (`xoxb-...`) for richer `chat.postMessage` delivery (**recommended**)
2. Configure destination channel (`#alerts` or channel ID) and save.
3. Run **Test send** to queue a safe test notification.
4. Start worker processing (`python services/api/scripts/run_worker.py`) so queued jobs are delivered.

Notes:
- OAuth install flow is not implemented yet; bot mode currently uses secure manual token setup.
- Slack callback/interactivity endpoints are not implemented in this release.
- Slack payloads always include top-level `text` plus Block Kit sections (fallback/accessibility safe).

### Alert routing behavior

- Routing is workspace-scoped and channel-scoped (`dashboard`, `email`, `webhook`, `slack`).
- Each channel rule supports:
  - `enabled` on/off,
  - `severity_threshold` (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`critical`),
  - optional module include/exclude lists,
  - optional target filters,
  - event type filters (currently `alert.created`).
- Dashboard persistence remains on by default (alerts are still saved); routing controls outbound channel fan-out at alert generation time.

### End-to-end operator loop

The live workflow now supports:

`analyze -> persist finding -> route alert (dashboard/email/webhook/slack) -> assign/escalate/suppress/accept -> create/update action -> export evidence`
- Plan enforcement for target limits, exports availability, and advanced module-config controls.

### New/updated environment expectations

No required new env vars were introduced for this pass beyond existing billing/email/auth vars. Existing billing entitlements now include additional limits (`max_targets`, `exports_enabled`, `alert_retention_days`) via migrations.

## Production readiness and UX polish upgrades (March 2026)

### Guided policy builder UX

Policy configuration for Threat Monitoring, Compliance Controls, and Resilience Monitoring now supports:

- guided fields, toggles, thresholds, and checklists by module
- inline summaries of effective policy behavior
- **Advanced policy configuration (JSON)** as an optional collapsible expert mode
- backend normalization for backwards compatibility with existing stored config keys

### Asset/target management UX

Assets and targets now include polished management workflows:

- search and filtering
- richer create/edit forms for metadata, owner/team, risk, notes, and tags
- enable/disable, duplicate (targets), and archive/delete actions
- clearer empty states and next-step guidance

### Slack integration modes

Slack now supports two workspace modes:

1. **Incoming webhook** (legacy-compatible)
2. **Bot token / chat.postMessage** (**recommended** for production)

Bot mode is currently a secure manual setup (OAuth install flow is not yet implemented).

### Integration health diagnostics

New admin-only diagnostics endpoints:

- `GET /system/integrations/health`
- `POST /system/integrations/test-email`
- `POST /system/integrations/test-slack`

These surface actionable readiness checks for Stripe, email, and Slack without exposing secret values.

### New/updated env vars

- `STRICT_PRODUCTION_BILLING=true` (optional strict fail-fast mode for production billing env validation)
- Existing Stripe vars remain required in production billing flows:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### “System ready” criteria for production

Before declaring production fully ready:

1. Stripe health checks pass (secret + webhook secret + configured plan price IDs).
2. Email provider is configured with valid sender/from address and test-send succeeds.
3. At least one Slack integration is configured and test-send succeeds.
4. Startup validation reports no production errors.

## Always-on monitoring worker

Run migrations and start the monitoring worker in a separate process:

```bash
python services/api/scripts/migrate.py
python -m services.api.app.run_monitoring_worker --interval-seconds 15
```

Optional env vars:
- `MONITORING_WORKER_NAME` (default: `monitoring-worker`)
- `MONITORING_ALERT_DEDUPE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (default: `900`)
- `THREAT_ENGINE_URL` and `THREAT_ENGINE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`

In production deploy three processes: web app, API, and monitoring worker (`python -m services.api.app.run_monitoring_worker`).
